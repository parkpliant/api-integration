# ParkPliant - Push API Integration

Our solutions support push of data via a flexible API.

- All data is pushed through HTTPS POST "application/json" to our API.
- All calls are authenticated via Basic authentication ("Authorization" header).
- Each push can contain from 1 to 1000 records of data.
- Our server will generally return one of the following responses
  - 200 – OK
    - This is a success response that means the transaction was accepted and queued for processing
    - It will include "application/json" content with a transaction id from our server and count of records received.
  - 204 - No Content
    - The request was properly formatted except for an empty payload, the request was discarded.
  - 400 – Bad Request
    - The request was improperly formatted, the payload was discarded
  - 401 – Unauthorized
    - The request came without authentication or with invalid credentials

```

In the above example:
- 3 citations were sent, sending 3 posts with one record each is also fine, though less efficient.  The post must always be an array ( [] in JSON ), even if the array only contains one element.

### Example Response
```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 55
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
    "id": "c31deb20-1069-40c8-b218-e7f7e63ba56d",
    "count": 3,
    "errors": []
}
```
In the above example:
- The `id` is a unique identifier supplied for the transaction, that can be used for transaction tracing.  We recommend recording this value when possible, although is it not required.
